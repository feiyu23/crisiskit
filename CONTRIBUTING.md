## 🎯 Code Guidelines

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Define types for props and data structures
- Avoid `any` - use proper types

### React

- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks

### Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Follow mobile-first responsive design
- Maintain accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

### Crisis UX Principles

Remember these when contributing:

- ⏱ **Speed over perfection** - Every second counts in a crisis
- 📱 **Mobile-first** - Most crisis users are on phones
- 🧩 **Minimal inputs** - Reduce cognitive load
- 🔊 **Broadcast-friendly** - Links will be shared via WhatsApp/SMS
- 🧘 **Emotional safety** - UI should reduce panic, not increase it

## 🌍 Translation

We welcome translations! To add a new language:

1. Create a new file in `/locales/[language-code].json`
2. Copy the structure from `/locales/en.json`
3. Translate all strings
4. Test the UI in your language
5. Submit a PR
