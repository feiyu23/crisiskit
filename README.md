## 🔥 Born from Real Crisis

In late 2025, during a devastating residential fire in Hong Kong, **thousands of people scrambled for help**. Official channels were drowning in requests. But something remarkable happened:

**Ordinary citizens self-organized using simple tools:**

- Google Forms & Sheets
- WhatsApp broadcasts
- Telegram groups
- Crowdsourced location notes
- Volunteers manually coordinating

The tools were **fragmented and messy—but they worked far better than sophisticated systems.**

> "In a crisis, speed beats perfection. Communities don't wait for official platforms. They build what they need with what they have." — Real disaster responders

**CrisisKit Lite is a tribute to that resilience.** It's not trying to replace official systems. It's **amplifying what communities are already doing—but 10x faster, with AI intelligence, and built for offline communities.**

## ⚡ Core Capabilities at a Glance

| Feature | What It Does | Why It Matters |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **⏰ 10-Second Setup** | Create a crisis form in seconds, no account needed | Time is life. Every second counts. |
| **🤖 AI Auto-Triage** | Gemini AI classifies urgency: Critical → Moderate → Low | Volunteers work on most critical needs first |
| **📍 Location Intelligence** | Pre-configured region/district dropdowns for fast location entry | Disaster responders need geographic data instantly |
| **🔗 Google Sheets Sync** | Auto-sync submissions to Google Sheets in real-time | Teams already use Sheets. Zero learning curve. |
| **📊 Live Dashboard** | Color-coded urgency, filtering, statistics, trends | Coordinators see patterns and bottlenecks immediately |
| **📱 Mobile-First Design** | Large buttons, minimal text, works on any phone | Most people access crisis info on phones |
| **🚫 Duplicate Detection** | Prevents spam, flags potential updates | Cuts down noise for coordinators |
| **🔒 Privacy-First** | Data stays with community, not third parties | Trust is essential in crisis |

## 🎯 The CrisisKit Workflow

```
Affected Person → Share CrisisKit Link → Submit Needs in 10s
                         ↓
              AI Triage (Critical/Moderate/Low)
                         ↓
            Auto-Sync to Google Sheets
                         ↓
         Volunteer Team Coordinates Response
```

### Why Not Just Use Google Forms + Sheets?

Real crisis scenario: A fire breaks out. People need help NOW. Let's compare:

| Task | Google Forms | CrisisKit |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Setup time** | 15-20 minutes | 10 seconds |
| **Mobile UX** | Clunky, text-heavy | Large buttons, SOS location tap |
| **Urgency sorting** | Manual (never happens) | Automatic (AI powered) |
| **Duplicate detection** | None (coordinator nightmare) | Automatic (flags patterns) |
| **Learning curve** | Minutes (forms are new for some) | Instant (everyone knows how to submit) |
| **Sheets integration** | Copy-paste (100 entries = 30min) | Real-time auto-sync (automatic) |
| **Offline capability** | No | Queued submissions when connection returns |

**In a real fire**, the difference between 15 minutes of setup and 10 seconds could mean the difference between chaos and coordination.

## 🎯 Crisis UX Principles

Disaster UX is fundamentally different from normal UX. When people are stressed, scared, or managing chaos, **cognitive load skyrockets**. This changes how humans interact with systems:

| Principle | Why It Matters |
|-----------|----------------|
| **🧨 No clutter** | Crisis users have almost no working memory available |
| **⏱ Time-to-action < 5s** | If someone can't create a form immediately, they'll abandon it |
| **📱 Mobile-first** | Most crisis communication happens on phones |
| **🔊 Broadcast-friendly** | Links will be shared through WhatsApp groups and voice notes |
| **🧩 Minimal inputs** | Complex forms fail. Short, descriptive fields succeed |
| **🧘 Emotional safety** | A "Thank you" message reduces panic |

## 🎯 Real-World Use Cases

### ✅ **CrisisKit is Perfect For:**

| Use Case | Example |
|----------|---------|
| **Natural Disasters** | Building fires, floods, earthquakes, typhoons—assess immediate needs |
| **Infrastructure Failure** | Power outages, water contamination—coordinate emergency resources |
| **Displacement** | Mass evacuation, shelter coordination—track who needs what |
| **Supply Chain Breakdown** | Food shortage, medical supplies—rapid distribution assessment |
| **Community Mutual Aid** | Neighborhood flooding, local emergency—peer-to-peer help coordination |
| **Evacuation Routes** | Track bottlenecks, coordinate transportation, identify vulnerable people |
| **Rapid Surveys** | Post-crisis assessment, damage surveys, accessibility needs |

**Why it works in these scenarios:**
- Speed is literally life-or-death
- You need data NOW, not in 2 hours
- Coordinators are already using Google Sheets
- People will use any tool that works—don't need perfection

### ⚠️ **Not Suitable For:**

- **Official government platforms** — Use certified emergency systems instead
- **Medical triage** — Requires professional medical oversight (CrisisKit supplements, not replaces)
- **Long-term case management** — Use dedicated CRM/database systems for ongoing support
- **Confidential law enforcement** — Not designed for sensitive investigations

## 💡 Our Philosophy

> **"In a crisis, people don't wait for perfect systems. They build what they need with the tools they have. CrisisKit Lite amplifies that instinct."**

We believe:

1. **Speed > Perfection** — A 10-second form deployed now saves more lives than a perfect form deployed in 2 weeks
2. **Community First** — Technology should serve communities, not the other way around
3. **Low-Tech Resilience** — Work when internet is down, when servers are full, when nothing is available
4. **Data Privacy** — Communities own their crisis data. We never store it on our servers
5. **Open Source First** — Crisis tech is too important to be proprietary

If CrisisKit helps even one community organize faster in the next emergency, it will have succeeded.

## 🙏 Inspired By Real Heroes

This project was born from witnessing grassroots responders during the **late 2025 Hong Kong fire**:

- **Thousands of citizens** organizing relief efforts
- **Volunteers** coordinating with Google Sheets + WhatsApp
- **Speed & resilience** beating official channels by hours
- **Human compassion** at massive scale

CrisisKit Lite is our tribute to their ingenuity. We're just making it easier.
